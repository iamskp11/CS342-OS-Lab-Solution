---------------------------------------------------------


For every bash file, first give permission by chmod -754 filename.

Note : It is not expected to give wrong number of command line arguments in every question. So, I have checked only for correct number of CLA.

Qn1.

Give command ./Qn1.sh
Further the interactive command will ask for inputs and finally output will be provided.

Qn2.

Give command ./Qn2.sh (integer)
Output will be displayed.

Qn3.

Two programs are there.
For shell, GIve command time ./Qn3.sh (integer) (integer).
You will be provided with output and time taken.

For C, GIve command gcc Qn3.c -o Qn3   , then ./Qn3
Give 2 integers .
Output will be provided.

Analysis :

For a= 1048576, b=1048575
Bash Shell exection time : 0.003 s
C execution time : 0.000259 s

For a= 2097152, b=2097151
Bash Shell execution time : 0.003 s
C execution time : 0.000274 s

We conclude that programming in Shell is slow, compared to C language.

Qn4.

Give command ./Qn4.sh.
You will be asked for password and then output will be provided.
